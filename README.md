PGoControl
==========

This does some things automatically when connecting your device via adb, like:

1. Making backups and clearing data.
2. Switching automagically between two account (main and alt), without losing configurations.
3. Pasting from your computer clipboard to the device directly.
4. Grabbing clipboard from your device to your computer.
5. And so on... check `--help` for all features.
